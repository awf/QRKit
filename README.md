# QRKit

This repository contains implementation of our WACV 2018 work [QRkit: Sparse, Composable QR Decompositions for Efficient and Stable Solutions to Problems in Computer Vision
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03773).

QRKit is an extension of Eigen C++ library that allows for efficient QR decomposition of sparse matrices with common sparsity patterns.
